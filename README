This is a template which can be used for a standard groovy project, including code coverage and complexity metrics reporting, as well as test coverage reporting.

Please note - this project is built using Gradle, and as such will need: 
-A working installation of Gradle (preferably the most recent production version); and
-An appropriate version of Java installed.

The following reports are available (in the reports directory):
-Cobertura (coverage)
-Code Metrics (metrics)
-Test Results (test-results)

A recent version of the metrics will be checked into the repo, but the reports can be run locally using the command 'gradle metrics'.

In addition, 'gradle test' can be used to run the test suite, and 'gradle build' will run a complete build.
